# Intel Bootcamp Projects

## About  
This repository contains a collection of small-scale AI projects built during **Intel AI4Youth** bootcamps. These include both learning-oriented models and real-life utility applications. All projects are clubbed into a single repository as they are lightweight and don't warrant dedicated repositories individually.
